[00:09.35] People-pleasing planet
[00:11.23] Got a million people saying how to plan it
[00:13.73] I can no longer stand it
[00:15.98] Gonna spend my days telling them to can it
[00:18.35] Each and to their own
[00:20.45] Got a salesman ringing my phone
[00:22.87] Tell me where to go
[00:25.02] No, I don't wanna hear the down low
[00:42.52] 
[00:27.01] I owe
[00:29.91] Nothing, not a penny, never wanna hear you preach
[00:32.14] No
[00:33.14] 
[00:35.66] Take me to the beach, ah
[00:38.22] You could have the mountains, ah
[00:40.32] You take the snow, ah
[00:42.73] It's way too cold
[00:44.41] My heart is cold enough, ah
[00:47.17] Push comes to shove, ah
[00:49.52] You could have the mountains, ah
[00:51.93] I'll take the beach
[01:01.43] 
[00:54.73] If you want it, come and get it
[00:56.98] Got a million people telling me they're with it
[00:59.35] And they got me at my limit
[01:01.59] And I'm telling you, I never spare a minute
[01:03.74] If you wanna keep on living
[01:06.19] For the sucker that is telling you your limit
[01:08.37] Gotta find out it's a gimmick
[01:10.68] Can't nobody tell you how to live it
[01:28.68] 
[01:12.68] I owe
[01:15.50] Nothing, not a penny, never walking on a leash
[01:17.73] No
[01:18.73] 
[01:21.47] Take me to the beach, ah
[01:23.76] You could have the mountains, ah
[01:26.16] You take the snow, ah
[01:28.31] It's way too cold
[01:30.04] My heart is cold enough, ah
[01:32.92] Push comes to shove, ah
[01:35.17] You could have the mountains, ah
[01:37.51] I'll take the beach
[01:47.01] 
[01:39.75] I'm better off alone
[01:41.98] Like a rolling stone
[01:44.23] Turning off my phone
[01:46.69] No one bringing me down, down, down, down
[01:51.35] Just give me some space
[01:53.56] That sun in my face
[01:55.71] And the days go on, and on, and on, and on (T-A-K-E, T-A-K-E)
[01:59.08] (T-A-K-E)
[02:03.58] 
[02:00.07] Take me to the beach, ah
[02:02.79] You could have the mountains, ah
[02:04.81] You take the snow, ah
[02:07.30] It's way too cold (it's way too cold)
[02:09.02] My heart is cold enough, ah
[02:12.19] Push comes to shove, ah
[02:14.26] You could have the mountains, ah
[02:16.42] I'll take the beach (I'll take the -, I'll take the -)
[02:18.33] Take me to the -
[02:26.33] 
[02:19.75] I don't have no friends, ask anyone
[02:24.21] Got me 'til the end, my favorite one
[02:27.61] Take me to the beach
[02:28.84] I don't have no friends, ask anyone (ask anyone)
[02:33.10] Got me 'til the end, my favorite one
[02:36.54] Take me to the beach
